UPDATE 2018
===========
This is mostly up on GitHub so I can reminisce and laugh at it. I wrote this while in high school, it was my first multi-file programming project, and I really had no idea what I was doing. But I stumbled through it somehow!

**Note that it is currently very broken on Windows 10 and high DPI displays** - maybe one day I'll patch it.

Game Thing Test: A simple game I made in high school

Basic Info
===

This game was created in 2013/14 by Jayden Milne. There is a lot more that I wanted to do, but this is it I guess.
Features: 
- Line transormation-based graphics (no images/textures) 
- Automatically scalable (no hard coded coordinates in the whole game!) (edit 2018 - yeah not so much)
- Double buffering, AntiAliasing (Disabled in renderer.vb, set smoothingmode to HighQuality)
- Collision detection (What I do after detecting the collisions, not so much)
- Flexible menu system (menuitems are added dynamically and there are no hardcoded locations) (edit 2018 - I spent way too much time on this)
- Inheritance based entity system 
- Health manager (shields/hull health)
- Model creator GUI (GTTGUI) to help make layers
- Lasers
- An xwing model
- Flexible model saving scheme (easy to add layers),
- Dynamic entity manager
- Diagnostics form
- Bugs
- Lag
- and much more

Long Term Goals
===
Probably not going to happen:

- Mouse steers ship
- A plot
- View is centered on player ship
- An actual HUD
- More baddies
- More projectiles
- Faster/more efficient collisons
- Options, sound, and much more

Please keep in mind that this is my first multifile code project ever.
