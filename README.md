Game Thing Test: The best thing to happen to videogames since ET for the Atari. Behold the wonder in syntax that is Visual Basic, and bow before the fruits of my first ever major programming project. No really, this is my first project ever, so you can't judge me for all of the atrocious stuff that I did. I WAS YOUNG AND RECKLESS, OKAY? Anyway, I'm uploading this mainly to play with GitHub and so you can see what not to do.
