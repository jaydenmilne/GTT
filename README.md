Game Thing Test: The best thing to happen to videogames since ET for the Atari. Behold the wonder in syntax that is Visual Basic, and bow before the fruits of my first ever major programming project. No really, this is my first project ever, so you can't judge me for all of the atrocious stuff that I did. I WAS YOUNG AND RECKLESS, OKAY? Anyway, I'm uploading this mainly to play with GitHub and so you can see what not to do.

Basic Info
===

From PauseMenu.vb:

This game was created in 2013/14 by Jayden Milne. There is a lot more that I wanted to do, but this is it I guess.
Features: 
- Fully vectorized graphics (no images/pictureboxes) 
- Automatically scalable (no hard coded coordinates in the whole game!) 
- Double buffering, AntiAliasing (Disabled in renderer.vb, set smoothingmode to HighQuality)
- Very accurate collisions (too accurate, collision detection slows the whole thing down)
- Flexible menu system (menuitems are added dynamically and there are no hardcoded locations) 
- Easy to create new ships/classes 
- Health manager (shields/hull health)
- Model creator GUI (GTTGUI) to help make layers
- Lasers
- An xwing model
- Flexible model saving scheme (easy to add layers),
- Beginnings of AI (commented out to make deadline)
- Dynamic entity manager
- Diagnostics form
- Bugs
- Lag
- and much more

Long Term Goals
===
Probably not going to happen:

- Mouse steers ship
- A plot
- View is centered on player ship
- An actual HUD
- More baddies
- More projectiles
- Faster/more efficient collisons
- Options, sound, and much more

Please keep in mind that this is my first multifile code project ever. I also think that this won't be very impressive because people won't realize all the work that went on under the hood (more than a half baked version of Monopoly). Oh well, wish I was more motivated outside school.
